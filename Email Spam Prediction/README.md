### Objective
Verifying whether an email is spam or not, and striving to minimize Type 1 errors, which involve mistakenly classifying a legitimate email as spam. While people may be more forgiving of Type 2 errors, which entail failing to identify spam emails, they are less tolerant of Type 1 errors, where non-spam emails are incorrectly marked as spam.
